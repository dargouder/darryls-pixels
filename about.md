### About Me

My name's Darryl Gouder, I'm from Malta (it's a tiny island in the Mediterranean) and I'm currently living in London, working as a Software Developer at MPC, part of the New Technology team.

I've got this website and blog to show some of the stuff I work on in my free time. Most of it will pertain to computer graphics, mostly ray tracing related stuff as it is a big passion of mine. I might occasionally post something else, it depends!

Apart from ray tracing, graphics and math, I like to play MMORPGs, a lot of different sports (mostly swimming) and I'm a big music affascinando.

If you ever want to chat about, feel free to email me or send me a DM on Twitter.

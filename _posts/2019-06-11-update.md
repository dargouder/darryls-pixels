I've been very silent for a while but I have a big update coming soon. I've been extensively working on my own raytracer, Solstice whilst also beefing up my real-time engine which I've called Equinox.

I've been writing the blog posts for the next Ray tracing in One Weekend chapters, which I'm quite excited about, I've tried to be as pedagogical as possible. 

I also have a post about how to go about building acceleration structures. In my opinion there isn't really a gentle introduction on how to do this, and I'd like to fill the void. Just general tips and advice. I'm writing about my own personal process and the mistakes I made and how I fixed and debugged stuff.

The big blog post I'm planning for the summer will be about bidirectional path tracing. I'm going to provide a very simple framework and scene, for people and walk them through the theory and implementation. I've been thinking a lot about this and my aim is to simplify the concepts as much as possible.

On the work-side, we're veeeeery busy with SIGGRAPH, but I'll share later on what we're doing, I don't want to spoil it, but it is going to be brilliant! Tomorrow I'm giving a talk to the London GPU meetup group and I'll talk about our initial efforts and investigations into getting some Realtime Ray tracing inside of Unity DXR. Whereas at GTC we kept it quite high level, I'll dive deeper this time.

Debugging my ray tracer - part 1

Working on my renderer sometimes leads to some hair-tearing moments when bugs start to come up. When you're tracing millions of rays and you've got millions of pixels, tracking down a visual bug is very tricky. 

This blog post is the first in a series where I'll discuss what I did to debug certain bugs that I encountered. The series isn't planned - when I get a bug which gives me a lot of grief, I'll write down what I did to find it and fix it.
